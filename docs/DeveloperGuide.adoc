== Introduction

This developer guide is for software developers or designers who want to understand the system design and implementation
of InternshipDiary.

== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `InternshipDiaryParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an internship application).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Internship Diary data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<InternshipApplication>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Status` list in `Internship Diary`, which `Internship Application` can reference. This would allow `Internship Diary` to only require one `Status` object per unique `Status`, instead of each `Internship Application` needing their own `Status` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Internship Diary data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== [Proposed] Undo/Redo feature
==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternshipDiary`.
It extends `InternshipDiary` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `internshipDiaryStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternshipDiary#commit()` -- Saves the current internship diary state in its history.
* `VersionedInternshipDiary#undo()` -- Restores the previous internship diary state from its history.
* `VersionedInternshipDiary#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone internship diary state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInternshipDiary()`, `Model#undoInternshipDiary()` and `Model#redoInternshipDiary()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternshipDiary` will be initialized with the initial internship diary state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single internship diary state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th internship application in the internship diary. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInternshipDiary()`, causing the modified state of the internship diary after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `internshipDiaryStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted internship diary state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add c/Google ...` to add a new internship application. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInternshipDiary()`, causing another modified internship diary state to be saved into the `internshipDiaryStateList`.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInternshipDiary()`, so the internship diary state will not be saved into the `internshipDiaryStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the internship application was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInternshipDiary()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous internship diary state, and restores the internship diary to that state.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial internship diary state, then there are no previous internship diary states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInternshipDiary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoInternshipDiary()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the internship diary to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `internshipDiaryStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest internship diary state, then there are no undone internship diary states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInternshipDiary()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the internship diary, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInternshipDiary()`, `Model#undoInternshipDiary()` or `Model#redoInternshipDiary()`. Thus, the `internshipDiaryStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInternshipDiary()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `internshipDiaryStateList`, all internship diary states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add c/Google ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire internship diary.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the internship application being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of internship diary states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedInternshipDiary`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::sort[]
=== Sort command

The find command allows the user to sort the currently visible list of internship applications. The following sequence
diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for the command:

image::SortSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following subsections will go through the general implementations of the sort command.

==== Implementation
The find command is implemented in the class `SortCommand` and uses the `SortCommandParser` class to parse the
arguments for the command.

To facilitate the sort command, several comparator classes implementing `Comparator<InternshipApplication>` are used:

* `ApplicationDateComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `ApplicationDate` field
in chronological order.
* `CompanyComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Company` field
in lexicographical order.
* `PriorityComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Priority` field
in ascending order.
* `StatusComparator` -- Comparator to compare internship applications by their `Status` field
by the order which they are declared in the Status Enum class.

The `SortCommandParser` looks for a acceptable prefix in the command, and passes the corresponding comparator to `SortCommand`.
If the number of such prefixes found is not exactly one, `SortCommandParser` throws a `ParseException`.

==== Reverse sort

This version of the command is invoked when the user enters the command with `reverse` as the
preamble text in the parameter, e.g. `sort reverse c/`. After retrieving the correct `comparator` to use,
the parser would pass `comparator.reversed()` to the constructor of `SortCommand` instead of `comparator`.
This would reverse the order in which the currently visible list of internship applications is sorted in.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to sort by multiple fields
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Accept only one field to sort by when using SortCommand.
This works as the list uses stable sort.
** Pros: More streamlined, less complex. +
`EnteredCommandsHistory` allows the user to get the sort command template back
in just one press of the up arrow key so there is little hassle. +
Users do not have to remember the order to place the arguments to get the sort they want.
** Cons: Feels a little restrictive.

* **Alternative 2**: Allow multiple fields to sort by.
** Pros: Two less key presses.
** Cons: Code becomes much more complex. +
Users has to remember the order to place the arguments to get the sort they want. +
Users are highly unlikely to use this feature, as sorting one field by one feels more natural. +
Harder to implement reverse sorting.

// end::sort[]

// tag::interview[]
=== Interview and Interview Commands
==== Implementation
The implementation of interviews will be facilitated by two overarching components, the Model Class `Interview`
which is associated to an `InternshipApplication` (see Model Diagram <<Design-Model>> ) and the Logic Classes `InterviewCommandParser` and `InterviewCommand`.

The class diagram below shows the classes associated to `Interview`. `Interview` will consist of the following variables:

* `boolean` isOnline -- indicates whether the interview is online.
* `ApplicationDate` interviewDate -- indicates the date of the interview.
* `Address` interviewAddress -- indicates the address of the interview.

In particular, `Interview` will rely on the `ApplicationDate` and `Address` classes in the Model to implement `interviewDate` and `interviewAddress`

image::InterviewClassDiagram.png[]

Interviews can only be modified through the `interview` command which relies upon `InterviewCommandParser` and `InterviewCommand` classes.
The `interview` command will encompass four types of sub-command: `add list edit delete`. Correspondingly, the `InterviewCommand`
class will be made abstract with specific implementation of each sub-command in an inheriting class, this can be seen in the diagram below.

image::InterviewCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Additionally, `InterviewCommand` will implement the `InterviewCommand#getInternshipApplication(Model, Index)` operation.
This is to facilitate all sub-commands to acquire the `InternshipApplication` to modify the `Interview` from.

`InterviewCommandParser` is the entry point to all `interview` sub-command. It will be invoked from `InternshipDiaryParser`
which is the primary logic parser for user input. The following sequence diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for
 `InterviewAddCommand`. All other sub-commands will follow the same invocation format.

image::InterviewCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How to implement different interview commands
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a standardized command with sub-command type parsed as user input.
** Pros: More streamlined, only one command. +
Able to use polymorphism to share operations between commands.
** Cons: Harder to implement and document.

* **Alternative 2**: Use separate commands for each different method of modifying interview.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: Makes the user remember more commands. +
Create a lot of repetition in code.
// end::interview[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find command

The find command allows the user to get a filtered list of internship applications. The following sequence
diagram will illustrate the process of invocation for the command:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[]

The following subsections will go through the general implementations of the find command, as well as the 2
versions of the command, find any match, and find match by fields.

==== Implementation
The find command is implemented in the class `FindCommand` and uses the `FindCommandParser` class to parse the
arguments for the command.

To facilitate the find command, several predicates classes implementing `Predicate<InternshipApplication>` are used:

* `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Company` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Role` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Address` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Phone` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate(List<String>
numbers)`.
* `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Email` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.
* `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Phone` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate(List<String>
numbers)`..
* `ApplicationDateIsDatePredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `ApplicationDate` field is
exactly the date supplied by its constructor `ApplicationDateIsDatePredicate(LocalDate date)`.
* `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` -- Predicate to check if an internship application's `Status` field contains any
substring matching any words in the list supplied by its constructor `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate(List<String>
keywords)`.

==== Find Any Match

This version of the command is invoked when the user enters the command with preamble text in the parameter, e.g.
`find google facebook` or `find google r/software`. The command will perform search for any internship application
where any of the fields `Company`, `Role`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Priority` or `Status` contains a substring
matching at least one word in the preamble and display them, e.g. `find google facebook` will look for internship
applications whose any of the above fields contains the substring `google` or `facebook`.

The searching and displaying of the internship application is done by performing an `OR` operation on all the predicates
`CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate` and
`StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` to get a single predicate and passing that into the method
`updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager` instance.

==== Find Match by Fields

This version of the command is invoked when the user enters the command without any preamble text in the parameter, e.g.
`find c/google r/software`. The command will perform a search for any internship application where the fields
`Company`, `Role`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Email`, `ApplicationDate`, `Priority` and `Status` match any of the supplied
word after their respective prefixes (if a field's prefix is not specified, the field is not checked),
e.g. `find c/google facebook d/01 02 2020` will look for internship applications where the `Company` field contains
a substring `google` or `facebook` and the `ApplicationDate` field matching the date 1st February 2020.

The searching and displaying of the internship application is done by performing an `AND` operation on the
required predicates that is any of `CompanyContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `RoleContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`AddressContainsKeywordsPredicate`, `PhoneContainsNumbersPredicate`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate`,
`ApplicationDateIsDatePredicate`, `PriorityContainsNumbersPredicate` and `StatusContainsKeywordsPredicate` to get a
single predicate and passing that into the method `updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager`
instance.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement the different versions of find command
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a standardized command with the version to invoke determined by the type of
user input parameters.
** Pros: More streamlined, only one command. +
This ensures that the user dont have to remember multiple command to use the different versions.
** Cons: Longer and less specific execute method.

* **Alternative 2**: Use separate commands for the different versions of find.
** Pros: More specific execute method for each of the command.
** Cons: Makes the user remember more commands.

* **Alternative 3**: Use the first word of the user input parameter to select which version of find command to invoke.
** Pros: Slightly more streamlined than multiple commands. +
This still requires user to remember the right words to invoke the different versions.
** Cons: Longer and less specific execution method.
// end::find[]

=== Archival Feature

This feature allows users to store their internship application(s) into the archival.

The entire mechanism is driven by three commands: 1) `archival`, 2) `archive`, 3) `unarchive`.

==== Implementation

The following sequence diagrams illustrates how these commands are executed.

1) The `archival` command is to switch the view from the master list to archival list, where they will be able to view
their archived internship applications.

image::ArchivalSequenceDiagram.png[]

2) The `archive` command moves an internship application from the main list to the archival list.

image::ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png[]

3) The `unarchive` command moves an internship application from the archival list to the main list.

image::UnarchiveSequenceDiagram.png[]

In essence, a user would use the `archival` or `list` command to switch between their views and execute the
`archive` or `unarchive` command respectively. To be specific, a user should not `archive` an internship application when it is
already in the archival -- doing so will raise an exception. This is identical for the unarchive command in the master list
as well.

To further illustrate the above process, you may view the activity diagram that follows.

image::ActivityDiagramArchiveCommand.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement the internship application archival mechanism
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Manipulate the current view of the internship diary to accommodate the archival mechanism.
This is easily achieved with efficient use of the FilteredList and Predicates, along with a boolean isArchived variable
for each internship application to help us decide if the internship application should be rendered.
** Pros: Cleaner code and more maintainable codebase. More efficient use of memory and resources as well.
** Cons: Users have to be mindful of the two different views in the internship diary.

* **Alternative 2**: Create a separate internship diary dedicated to handle archived internship applications.
** Pros: Straightforward and intuitive. +
This should be easily understood by users as the idea is to replicate the current internship diary, with the same commands and features.
To move internship application, one just has to archive / unarchive from the appropriate internship diary.
** Cons: Users will have to deal with two internship diaries, which can be undesirable.
This approach is memory-inefficient as well.


=== Statistics Feature

This feature allows users to view relevant metrics for their internship application(s).

Such metrics include the amount of internship applications sent, and the percentage of internship applications in each
status category -- `wishlist`, `applied`, `interview`, `offered`, `rejected`.

Users will be able to view those metrics from two areas on the application: 1) `StatisticsBarFooter`, and 2) `StatisticsWindow`.

==== Implementation

`StatisticsBarFooter` serves as a quick view of the internship applications count. This bar footer is always visible to user
and is attached to the `MainWindow` of the application.

`StatisticsWindow` serves as an additional graphical statistics interface for users to get a visual breakdown of their internship
application(s) in the form of a bar chart or pie chart.

Users will be able to bring up the `StatisticsWindow` by executing the command `stats`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Which list to retrieve data from to generate statistics
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Using filtered ObservableList +
The filtered list is dynamically updated by `find` and `sort` command. The statistics model will generate statistics based
on the dynamic filtering changes that occur in the list (the current view selected by user).
** Pros: Users will be choose which list they want to view the relevant statistics for.
Works well with `archival`, `list`, and `find` commands that dynamically changes the list.
** Cons: Often re-computation upon changes in the filtered list may cause some performance bottleneck.

* **Alternative 2**: Using base list that contains all of the internship application(s)
The base list is not filtered according to predicate(s) set by users.
** Pros: Recomputes lesser than using filtered ObservableList as it only recomputes upon addition(s), deletion(s), or changes
in an internship application stored in the list.
** Cons: May be unintuitive to some extent for users when the statistics do not tally with the current view of the list.

===== Aspect: How to store the statistics generated from data
A list of internship application(s) will be passed into the statistics model and upon function call,
the statistics model will iterate through the list and generate/update the latest statistics accordingly.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Storing the mapping between each status and count using a HashMap +
The idea is to retrieve all the statuses available from the enum (whenever the statistics model is created)
and creating a HashMap with those status as the key and respective count as the value.
** Pros: Extensible and reusable. Regardless of any changes, this system can dynamically handle the addition, deletion, or changes in statuses. +
** Cons: Seemingly negligible cons for our particular usage.

* **Alternative 2**: Store each status count in separate variables that are initialized upon the creation of statistics model.
** Pros: Straightforward and very easy to understand for future developers.
** Cons: Very inextensible.

//tag::reminder[]
=== Reminder Command

The reminder command displays to users a list of internship applications which:

* have status `wishlist` and need to be submitted in 7 days
* have status `interview` and interviews scheduled in 7 days

The following sequence diagram shows how the command is executed:

.Sequence Diagram of `ReminderCommand`
image::ReminderSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Implementation
The reminder command is implemented in the class `ReminderCommand` and instantiates two predicates
`ApplicationDateDuePredicate` and `InterviewDateDuePredicate` with every call of the command.

To facilitate the reminder command, several predicates classes implementing `Predicate<InternshipApplication>` are used:

* `ApplicationDateDuePredicate` -- Predicate to check whether the `ApplicationDate` field of an internship application
has a date of the current date or within 7 days of the current date.

* `StatusIsWishlistPredicate` -- Predicate to check whether the `Status` field of an internship application is
`wishlist`.

* `InterviewDateDuePredicate` -- Predicate to check whether there is at least one interview in the `ArrayList<Interview>
interviews` of an internship application that has a date of the current date or within 7 days from the current date.

* `StatusIsInterviewPredicate` -- Predicate to check whether the `Status` field of an internship application is
`interview`.

* `IsNotArchivedPredicate` -- Predicate to check whether an internship application is not archived.

Firstly, an `AND` operation on the `ApplicationDateDuePredicate` and `StatusIsWishlistPredicate` as well as another
`AND` operation on the `InterviewDateDuePredicate` and  `StatusIsInterviewPredicate` are performed. Next, an `OR`
operation is performed on the predicates from the previous two `AND` operations. An 'AND' operation is then performed on
the predicate obtained from the previous `OR` operation and the `IsNotArchivedPredicate`. The final predicate produced is
then passed into the method `updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager` instance.

A comparator `ApplicationDateAndInterviewDateComparator` implementing `Comparator<InternshipApplication>` is also
passed into the method `updateFilteredInternshipApplicationList()` of the `ModelManager` instance to sort internship
applications in terms of which application is more urgent. It compares internship applications by their
`ApplicationDate` field as well as the earliest interview date in the `ArrayList<Interview> interviews` of the
applications, in order of either date being closer to current date. If two internship applications have the same date
in their `ApplicationDate` field, it compares them by the earliest interview date in the `ArrayList<Interview>
interviews` of the applications in order of which application has an interview that comes first.

==== Design considerations

====== Aspect: The order to display the internship applications
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Display the internship applications in the order of either their `ApplicationDate`
or `interviewDate` of the earliest interview scheduled in `ArrayList<Interview> interviews` is closer to current date.

** Pros: More useful to the user as the user can directly know which internship application to focus on more, regardless
of whether it is to prepare for the submission of the application, or to prepare for an interview scheduled.
** Cons: Longer code.

* **Alternative 2**: Display the internship applications in the order of which application's `ApplicationDate` is closer
to current date.

** Pros: Cleaner code.
** Cons: Has the assumption that an internship application with a earlier `ApplicationDate` will have an interview
scheduled at an earlier `interviewDate` as compared to an application with later `ApplicationDate`. User might miss out
on a earlier `interviewDate` for an application with later `ApplicationDate` and additional commands have to be typed in
to check `interviewDate`.
//end::reminder[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
