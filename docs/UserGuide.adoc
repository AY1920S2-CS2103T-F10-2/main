== Introduction

Internship Diary is an application to assist students in managing their internship applications. The Internship Diary
will be able to help you in tracking, tagging and reviewing all your internship applications. Additionally, Internship
Diary is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits
of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

.  Download the latest `internshipdiary.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
