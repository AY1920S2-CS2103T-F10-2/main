<div class="paragraph">
<p>Internship Diary is a desktop-based internship application tracking software.
The idea for this software came about when we realised that the nature of a computer science degree is internship-driven;
in the sense that having the best possible internship experience during candidature will greatly improve your chance of landing a good job as a fresh graduate.
Essentially, your first big internship will serve as a pivotal moment for your future career. Having said that, internship application is often a
tedious and messy process, with companies having different hiring processes and requirements.
We set out to tackle this pain point&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by coming up with a solution to help computer science students manage and streamline their internship application journey
Ultimately, we aim to make every student&#8217;s internship hunt during their four years as a computer science undergraduate a pleasant one, and hopefully maximise their chances of landing the best possible internship.</p>

<p>Implemented the Archival System
What it does: The archival system allows users to move their internship applications from the main list to a back-up list which is known as the archival.
Justification: This feature is particularly important as it helps users to organise their internship application(s). Whenever there are
internship application(s) that are no longer relevant / are of interest to the user, he/she can archive those internship application(s) so that
it "declutters" their main list. This allows them to focus on the internship application(s) that are more important currently.
Highlights: The archival feature seems trivial as it is usually a staple feature in many tracking applications. However, the difficult part comes in deciding what is the sustainable and extensible way to
implement this feature. You may view my developer guide to read more about the design considerations involved in this implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Created a statistics dashboard.
What it does: The statistics dashboard dynamically generates relevant statistics from the list of internship application(s) in the current view.
This provides users with a visualization of their internship application journey in terms of numbers.
Justification: The hunt for internship can be seen as a journey of growth in terms of personal and professional development.
By having useful and relevant statistics, one can gain insight into what they are good at and what they can work on to make themselves a more attractive candidate for internship roles.
